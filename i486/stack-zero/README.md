# Welcome to your first steps
Here we will see the basics, and fundamentals of a working program.

## Source code
Here is the source code of our [first challenge (stack zero)](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/).
```c
/*
 * phoenix/stack-zero, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable.
 *
 * Scientists have recently discovered a previously unknown species of
 * kangaroos, approximately in the middle of Western Australia. These
 * kangaroos are remarkable, as their insanely powerful hind legs give them
 * the ability to jump higher than a one story house (which is approximately
 * 15 feet, or 4.5 metres), simply because houses can't can't jump.  */

  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}

## A program
What i want to tell you first is it doesn't matter what languages a sofware is written in, the same things are hapenning in the low level circuit, the CPU, and the memory, etc.  of your computer, they can be differences, but a little ones.

And if you understand how low level stuff works, the operating system, kernel, stack, assembly, etc. there are many things, but if you begin from that and in the same time learning high level things, trust me that's what i will call a shortcut.
Anyway, if you are new to this stuff, don't pannic, all names that you don't understand are just names used to identify a concept or a thing, so as long as you have a mind, you will understand.
