# Welcome to your first steps
Here we will see the basics, and fundamentals of a working program.

## Source code
Here is the source code of our [first challenge (stack zero)](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/).
```c
/*
 * phoenix/stack-zero, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable.
 *
 * Scientists have recently discovered a previously unknown species of
 * kangaroos, approximately in the middle of Western Australia. These
 * kangaroos are remarkable, as their insanely powerful hind legs give them
 * the ability to jump higher than a one story house (which is approximately
 * 15 feet, or 4.5 metres), simply because houses can't can't jump.  */ 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

## Understanding the code
Here we can see that first of all as many programs written in C, you will often find libraries included at the first lines, as we can see here, which gives the programmer more functionality to use.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```

We can see the next line.

```c 
#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"
```

This related to the language, however, is just a way to reduce repetitions in programming, so when the program will be compiled in first stages the compiler will transform any occurence of BANNER for example here, to the text provided in the #define line, which the text between the double quotes, and here we can see that's is in a new line but in can be in the same, but here to more readability, the programmer break to a newline, but to so he add a backslash which will escape the newline character itself, so in the eyes of the compiler that's only one line.

Here want to point at this point, is that you can't, and you don't need to undertand everything
