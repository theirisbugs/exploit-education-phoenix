# Welcome to your first steps
Here we will see the basics, and fundamentals of a working program.

## Source code
Here is the source code of our [first challenge (stack zero)](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/).
```c
/*
 * phoenix/stack-zero, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable.
 *
 * Scientists have recently discovered a previously unknown species of
 * kangaroos, approximately in the middle of Western Australia. These
 * kangaroos are remarkable, as their insanely powerful hind legs give them
 * the ability to jump higher than a one story house (which is approximately
 * 15 feet, or 4.5 metres), simply because houses can't can't jump.  */ 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"

char *gets(char *);

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;

  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);

  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

## Understanding the code
Here we can see that first of all as many programs written in C, you will often find libraries included at the first lines, as we can see here, which gives the programmer more functionality to use.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
```

We can see the next line.

```c 
#define BANNER \
  "Welcome to " LEVELNAME ", brought to you by https://exploit.education"
```

This related to the language, however, is just a way to reduce repetitions in programming, so when the program will be compiled in first stages the compiler will transform any occurence of BANNER for example here, to the text provided in the #define line, which the text between the double quotes, and here we can see that's is in a new line but in can be in the same, but here to more readability, the programmer break to a newline, but to so he add a backslash which will escape the newline character itself, so in the eyes of the compiler that's only one line.

Here I want to say at this point, is that you can't, and you don't need to undertand everything

Then we have
```c
char *gets(char *);
```
This line is not actually a code that will execute, as anything that's not inside a function in C, and also especially the function need to be called from the main function, as any C program begin running from the main function, so any code that's inside main it the code the program will be executed. Of course except if you cutomize that by telling the compiler.

So what's this line do? actually nothing, it just tell the compiler that there's a function called gets that takes a pointer to a char type (a character or an array of characters (string)).

Going forward, you will need to understand code to exploit, so by researching, or even learning the language, that will be a good recommendation.

Now we are in main:
```c 
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
```
What we haven't talk about, the types, as the function gets is prefixed by a char, and now here the main function by an int, those are types of the values they will return to the calling function.

Here we can see that main function has two paramters, the first is an integer which will get the number of arguments provide for the program when it will be running (note: that the program name is the first argument, and it will be always there), and the second argument get the actual argument's string, as an array. 

You need more research on the language C, and actually learn it, if you don't get things here.

Next we have:
```c
  struct {
    char buffer[64];
    volatile int changeme;
  } locals;
```
Struct is the way C give you the ability to decalare variables that's related to each other, like an object, or something like so.

So here we have an array of characters that is 64 bytes length, and an integer variable, the volatile keywork is used to tell the compiler that is variable gonna change at any time, again this more compicated, you just need to search about it.

One thing here, is that the locals keyword, it's a variable now with the above struct, it's just a way to declare variable with the struct itself declared.

Next:
```c
  printf("%s\n", BANNER);

  locals.changeme = 0;
  gets(locals.buffer);
```

Let's speed up, this is something you need actually to learn about it, in my opinion of course.

So here we have the printf function which print out a format string, which means briefly a string containing variables inside, and you provide the variables as paramters to the function, and then the fornmat specifiers for each variables in the format string itself, and the printf do the job.

Then we set the changeme variable of the locals variable to 0, and then the gets function it a function that gets the input from the user as we will see.

Next:
```c
  if (locals.changeme != 0) {
    puts("Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!");
  } else {
    puts(
        "Uh oh, 'changeme' has not yet been changed. Would you like to try "
        "again?");
  }

  exit(0);
}
```
Finally the way of C to make condition and checks if the changme variable of the locals variable "object" has changed. Then exit with terminated the program with the 0 paramater give a way to tell the OS, that's the program terminated with success, like a status.
