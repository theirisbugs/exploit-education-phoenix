# Exploitation
In the source we can see that there's a format string vulnerability in the ```sprintf``` function as the format string is a variable that we can control.

Here we can give a format string, but we have a limitation which is the size, which is 14 bytes. 

What we need to do is to figure out the address of the ```dest```, using gdb as here there's no protection or changes in addresses when the same program run over and over again.
